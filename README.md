## Application Details

This application is used as a dual purpose tool to search for job listings in a givin area, and to search for relevant news articles.  Once you have entered in your search criteria you are brought to another page that displays the job listings and news articles.  This is a great tool for learning about something new to you as a developer by reading the articles provided, and for looking for a new job within your area or a new area if you are looking to move.  

The landing page presents you with the information about the application.  This page also allows you to enter your search criteria.  You will see two input fields on the page.  The first field, the one on the left, is where you enter your search terms that will filter what you are looking for.  For example IF you wanted to lookup Ruby or Vue.js then you would enter "Ruby" or "Vue.js" in that field.  The second search field is where you enter the city that you want to search for job listings in.  For example if you wanted to lookup listings in Washington DC then you would just enter "Washington DC" in that search field.  Once you have your search term and city location entered just click on the search button and get your results.
